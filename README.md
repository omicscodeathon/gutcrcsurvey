#Background 
The exponential growth in metagenomic data has led to the development of various bioinformatic pipelines designed to process and analyze 16S rRNA sequencing data. However, the challenge lies in accurately evaluating the performance of these pipelines due to the absence of standardized metrics and validation approaches. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by conducting a thorough examination of the literature, consolidating knowledge on the diverse metrics employed in assessing the reliability and efficiency of 16S rRNA metagenomic pipelines.
Understanding the nuances of comparative metrics is paramount for researchers and practitioners seeking to choose the most suitable pipeline for their specific study objectives. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score play pivotal roles in evaluating the accuracy of taxonomic assignments. Sensitivity and specificity provide insights into the ability of pipelines to identify true positive and true negative classifications. By synthesizing information from a myriad of studies, this review offers a comprehensive overview of the strengths and limitations associated with different metrics, empowering researchers to make informed decisions based on the specific requirements of their projects.
Moreover, the review extends its focus beyond metrics to delve into the validation approaches employed in the field. Robust validation is crucial for ensuring the reliability of metagenomic pipelines, yet there exists a lack of consensus on standardized validation practices. This review systematically examines and contrasts various validation methods, shedding light on their applicability, strengths, and potential limitations. By doing so, it provides a roadmap for researchers to navigate the complex landscape of validation strategies, fostering a more standardized and rigorous approach to assessing the performance of 16S rRNA metagenomic pipelines.
In essence, this systematic review serves as a pivotal resource for the metagenomics community, offering a deep dive into the comparative metrics and validation approaches essential for advancing the accuracy and reliability of 16S rRNA metagenomic analyses. As the field continues to evolve, this review lays the foundation for future developments in methodology and sets the stage for the establishment of best practices in the evaluation of metagenomic pipelines.
